In this edition of `CYBERSECURITY MUSINGS`, I’m sharing some thoughts on how trust is evolving online. Trust and safety aren’t just buzzwords—they’re part of our everyday lives. We’re always making judgments about who and what we can trust. My understanding of trust has been shaped by game theory - for example, one mathematical perspective on trust is represented by equation:

{% highlight ruby %} Total Trust Score = (Character x Connections x Competency) x Time {% endhighlight %}

I also recommend visiting [Ncase](https://ncase.me/trust/), a fascinating interactive game that shows how trust builds and breaks down in cooperative societies. Definitely worth checking out if you have a few minutes!
