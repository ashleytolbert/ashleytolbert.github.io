In this post on `CYBERSECURITY MUSINGS`, you'll find my thoughts on the evolving state of trust on the Internet. Trust and safety isn't just an academic vertical but a way of life - we assesss trust and safety every day. Mathematically, my comprehension of trust was influenced heavily by game theory. One equation for trust is:

{% highlight ruby %} Total Trust Score = (Character x Connections x Competency) x Time {% endhighlight %}

I've also enjoyed this site: [Ncase](https://ncase.me/trust/) - a fun interactive game exploring how trust evolves and errodes in cooperative societies. I highly suggest checking it out.
